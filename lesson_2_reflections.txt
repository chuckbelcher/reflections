How is the staging area different from teh working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? The staging directory is different from the working directoy because changes to files in the staging directory are tracked where changes to files in the working directory are not. Have a working directory for transient files eliminates the need to have non relivant changes tracked.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical changes. The git diff --staged allows you to see what changes will be part of a commit.
